  "index.faq.q1.question": "How your service charged?",
  "index.faq.q2.answer": "We use cryptographic technology called \"ring signature\" to achieve anonymity and authenticity, theoretically. Besides, we enforce all voters use Tor network to maintain anonymity when submitting tickets to us.",
  "index.faq.q2.question": "How do you ensure anonymity and authenticity?",
  "index.faq.q3.answer": "First, you need to sign up in our website. Second, you should create a new ballot, specify ticket fields, and invite voters. Here you need to manually distribute the invitation code to each voter. After all voters registered, you need to lock the voter list, lock ticket field list, and notify voters to pre-vote. After pre-voting, you start actual voting for a limited time, in which voters submit their tickets. After you stop voting, the ballot is marked finished.",
  "index.faq.q3.question": "What do I need to do as an organizer?",
  "index.faq.q4.answer": "After receiving the invitation code from the organizer, you should visit our website to register as voter. (Note: if one participates in multiple ballots, s/he must register separately for them to avoid breaking anonymity.) Your identity is proven by the private key (essentially a long string) instead of password, and you will receive your private key during registration. Your private key never leaves your computer! During pre-voting (see FAQ #3), you download the ticket and digitally \"sign\" it with your private key. During voting, you must use Tor network to anonymously submit your signed ticket to us. You can track whether your submission succeeded or not - of course via Tor!",
  "index.faq.q4.question": "What do I need to do as a voter?",
  "index.faq.q5.answer": "If we allow retrieving ballot meta info (such as fields list) and ticket submission at the same time, it's highly likely that the ticket submitted immediately after a information retrieval is from the one who performed the retrieval. Since we don't enforce using Tor when retrieving ballot meta info, the anonymity of ticket submitter is broken.",
